# Movie Samurai :surfer:
 This is a .net webapp that uses an API call to a movie database to retrieve a list of movies depending on a search term. We then retrieve a list of cast members based on the selected movie. Finally we obtain additional info depending on which cast member is selected, if the cast member has an active twitter account we retrieve an array of recent tweet via twitters API.
